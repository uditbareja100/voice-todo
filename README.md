I have created a Voice based Todo application for ease of use for elderly people

you can access the application [here](https://uditbareja100.github.io/voice-todo/) 

In this application you can add task by clicking on microphone button and start by saying "ADD" keyword

For Example you want to add a task: Get medicine, Say: ADD Get Medicine & it will be added to your list
